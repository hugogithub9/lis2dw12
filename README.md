This project was part of my exploration of embedded Rust as sensor. Although the LIS2DW12 supports both SPI and I2C, most available examples focused only on SPI.
To better understand how embedded communication works, I decided to implement the I2C communication logic myself, both in blocking and non-blocking versions.
This hands-on approach helped me gain a deeper understanding of:
how I2C works at the hardware and software level,
how to communicate with slave devices in Rust,
and how to handle low-level errors properly.

# `lis2dw12`

A no_std compatible Rust driver for the low power ST 3-Axis MEMS 14-bit accelerometer LIS2DW12 using the SPI bus

## Example

```rust
// create the device
// where spi implements Transfer<u8, Error = SpiError>,
// and cs implements OutputPin<Error = PinError>
let mut accel = Lis2dw12::new(spi, cs);

// confirm that communication is working
accel.check_who_am_i()?;

// set up the device
accel.set_operating_mode(OperatingMode::HighPerformance)?;
accel.set_low_noise(true)?;
accel.set_full_scale_selection(FullScaleSelection::PlusMinus2G)?;
accel.set_output_data_rate(OutputDataRate::Hp100HzLp100Hz)?; // 100 Hz

// get raw data
let raw = accel.accel_raw()?;
rprintln!("raw: {:?}", raw);

```

or take a look at a working example using an STM32 bluepill [here](https://github.com/ninjasource/accelerometer-test)


> Note that this crate implements the traits in the accelerometer crate. If you have problems figuring out how to propagate errors then take a look at the bluepill working example linked above.

## Features

This crate implements the `RawAccelerometer<I16x3>` trait by default. If you need the `Accelerometer` trait then enable the `out_f32` feature. For example:

```toml
# cargo.toml
lis2dw12 = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["out_f32"] }
```

This crate also exposes an experimental async interface which can be found in the non_blocking module. To use this module you must enable the `non_blocking` feature. This is only available on Rust nightly.

```toml
# cargo.toml for async (requires Nightly)
lis2dw12 = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["out_f32", "non_blocking"] }
```
